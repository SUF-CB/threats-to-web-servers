<p> There are 3 Security risks that can cause web servers to be corupted, below is a brief explanation with images that talk about the threats to web servers. </p>
    
  <h2>Hackers Installing Malware on the Web Server:</h2>   
    
    
    <p1> Hackers will try to install malware on a webserver for a variety of different reasons. They might want to install bots to run from the server, they might want to infect end users when they use the website and they might want to monitor files and communications to get end users' personal details.</p1>  <br><br>

    <br>
    <h2>Brute Force Attack:</h2>   
    
    <p1> Hackers try to get access to a web server by finding the passwords for  end user accounts by  signing  up to a newsletter and create a password so that they can log on to parts of that website.
The passwords will be saved as a hash which hides the plain text password so any hackers will try to break the password to be able to use it to gain access to the web server.
This is done through  software that generates large amounts of possible passwords and keeps trying them against the user account logons in the hope that one will be successful.
A brute force attack could use a dictionary in a database and the automated software runs through all of the possibilities or it could just generate commonly used passwords or random combinations of characters and symbols.</p1> <br><br>

<h2>Man in the Middle Attack:</h2>   
    
    <p1> Hackers will try to get information by reading the content of data packets while they are being transmitted on the internet by intercepting the packets as they are being transmitted by controlling a router that is a normal part of the internet. </p1><br><br>
