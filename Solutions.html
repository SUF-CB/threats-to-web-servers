<p> Here are some solutions to solve these threats:</p>
    
 <h2>Hackers Installing Malware on the Web Server:</h2>  

    <p1>  A web server is usually an open system so it can be very easy for hackers to install malware files. A Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System(HIPS) should be used on a web server because it can identify new files or changes to files. If the new or changed files are not done by the web master, they are likely to have been installed by a hacker.

The HIPS keeps a database of files that are used by the web server to run and the HIPS records data about the files such as the original file size. The HIPS will be able to identify if a file has been modified and can report to the web master for it to be checked out and any threat eliminated </p1>

 <h2>Brute Force Attack:</h2>   
    <p1> When users sign up to a new account or a newsletter they should be given instructions about how to create what are called 'strong passwords'.  A strong password must be totally random, have between eight to fifteen characters, must have upper case and lower case letters, at least one number, at least one symbol and should be changed at least every year.

The length is important because if it is long, it will take much longer for any automated, brute force programs to run through all of the possibilities.

The website should have a script that checks the password that the user has chosen and tell them what they need to do to make it stronger. </p1>

   <h2>Man in the Middle Attack:</h2>    
    <p1> The webserver needs to be setup to use secure encryption methods. There are SSL/TLS. A key is used to encrypt the packets so that a man in the middle will only see encrypted text which will be meaningless. There are two keys, the browser uses a public key and the web server uses a private key.

Any text sent using the public key can only be decrypted on the web server by that private key.

The way to use TLS/SSL is to buy a certificate from a company called a Certificate Authority and then the website that you run will be issued with private and public keys that you can use for encryption.</p1>
